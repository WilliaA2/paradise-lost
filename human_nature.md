> What is Milton revealing about human nature in creating this dialogue?

By emphasizing the ultimate power of Satan, Milton gives responsibility for all evil actions of
humans to Satan. In Milton's worldview, humans are just the powerless subjects of all powerful
good and evil forces. The balance of power between God and Satan provides evidence that all
humans have a duality of good and evil within them.
